**Ph.D candidate** \
**Affiliation**: Department of ECE, Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea \
**Email**: cheeun0914@gmail.com, cheeun914@snu.ac.kr \
**Google scholar**: [profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HHjMKhIAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao)

I am a Ph.D student majoring in computer vision at SNU computer vision lab, advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/).


## **Research Interests**

I am interested in efficient deep learning and **low-level image restoration** problems, such as image super-resolution, to handle practical issues in deep learning.
Recently I am mainly working on designing lightweight networks for low-level image restoration problems with network optimization and acceleration techniques, especially **quantization**.
