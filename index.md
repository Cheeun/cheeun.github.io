# [Publications](./publications.html) | [CV]()

**Ph.D candidate** \
**Affiliation**: Department of ECE, Seoul National University (SNU), Seoul, Korea \
**Email**: cheeun0914(at)gmail(dot)com, cheeun914(at)snu(dot)ac(dot)kr \
**Google scholar**: [profile]()

I am a Ph.D student majoring in computer vision at SNU computer vision lab, advised by [Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee](https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/kmlee/).


## **Research Interests**

I am interested in deep learning and low-level image restoration problems, especially **image super-resolution**.
Recently I mainly working on reconstructing high-resolution images from real-world inputs.
My research topics also include network optimization and acceleration to handle practical issues in deep learning.


## **News**

- One paper got accepted to **[WACV 2022](http://wacv2022.thecvf.com/home)**!
  -  **Cheeun Hong***, Heewon Kim*, Sungyong Baik, Junghun Oh, and Kyoung Mu Lee, "DAQ: Channel-Wise Distribution-Aware Quantization for Deep Image Super-Resolution Networks."
  - Code and demo will be released soon.

<!-- - Our paper got accepted to **IEEE TPAMI** (_IF 16.39_)!
  - **Sanghyun Son***, Jaeha Kim*, Wei-Sheng Lai, Ming-Hsuan Yang, and Kyoung Mu Lee, "Toward Real-World Super-Resolution via Adaptive Downsampling Models."
  - Code and demo will be released soon.

- One paper got accepted to **[CVPR 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/)**!
  - **Sanghyun Son** and Kyoung Mu Lee, "SRWarp: Generalized Image Super-Resolution under Arbitrary Transformation."
  - You can find the demo code from our [github](https://github.com/sanghyun-son/srwarp).

- I am co-organizing the **[6th NTIRE workshop and challenges](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire21/)** in conjunction with **[CVPR 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/)**. Me, [Seungjun Nah](https://seungjunnah.github.io/) and Suyoung Lee are in charge of the following image deblurring and video super-resolution challenge tracks:
  - **Image Deblurring** Track 1. Low Resolution, Track 2. JPEG artifacts,
  - **Video Super-Resolution** Track 1. Spatial, Track 2. Spatio-Temporal.
  - Detailed challenge reports will be presented in the upcoming NTIRE 2021 workshop.

- Sanghyun have implemented an efficient bicubic resizing algorithm in PyTorch that is compatible with the MATLAB reference. Please check it from [here](https://github.com/sanghyun-son/bicubic_pytorch). -->
